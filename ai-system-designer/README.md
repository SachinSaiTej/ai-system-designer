# 🧠 AI System Design Platform

> **Design complex systems — intelligently.**  
> This platform leverages AI to generate **High-Level** and **Low-Level** system designs, analyze **trade-offs**, and evolve architectures based on user requirements — all in one collaborative web environment.

---

## 🚀 Vision

Modern system design requires deep expertise and fast iteration. This project aims to **bridge human architectural reasoning with AI-powered design exploration**.

By integrating intelligent reasoning models with a modular design pipeline, the goal is to create a **System Design Assistant** that can:
- Interpret **product or technical requirements** in natural language.
- Generate **complete architecture proposals** (HLDs, LLDs, sequence diagrams, database schemas).
- Analyze **scalability, reliability, and cost trade-offs**.
- Provide **real-time updates** as requirements evolve.

Ultimately, it should enable engineers to move from *idea → architecture → prototype* faster than ever before.

## 🧩 Current Stage (Early Development)

✅ Project initialization  
✅ Frontend setup using Next.js  
✅ Python backend boilerplate setup  
✅ Basic API structure for prompt → AI response  
✅ Repo structure planning  

🔜 Next steps:

## 🌟 Key Features (Planned)

### 🧠 AI-Powered System Design
- Parse natural-language problem statements.
- Generate system architecture diagrams (HLD, LLD).
- Explain trade-offs between different approaches.

### ⚖️ Trade-off Analyzer
- Evaluate **scalability**, **reliability**, **cost**, and **complexity** of proposed designs.
- Provide recommendations for **optimizations** or **alternative architectures**.

### 🔄 Design Evolution
- Allow iterative input (“Now add caching”, “Make it multi-region”, etc.).
- Track how design evolves over time with AI-generated diffs.

### 🗂️ Design Library (Future)
- Curated collection of best-practice architectures (e.g. “Uber-like system”, “E-commerce platform”, etc.).
- Generate new designs inspired by existing patterns.

### 💬 Collaboration Tools (Future)
- Realtime collaborative design discussions.
- AI-assisted feedback for peer review.
